# Prospects from ILC

This series of notebooks contain all the code to reproduce the data in Section 6.3 of my PhD thesis, which is adapted from [2105.05095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05095)

* [01](01_ILCProspects.ipynb): EW observables in each scenario with the improved ILC uncertainties.
* [02](02_LikelihoodFits.ipynb): Likelihood plots including the ILC prospects for the EW observables.
* [03](03_RKRD.ipynb): Plots for RK(\*) and RD(\*).
