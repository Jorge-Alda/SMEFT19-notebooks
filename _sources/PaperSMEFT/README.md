# Fit to SMEFT coefficients I

This series of notebooks contain all the code to reproduce the data in Section 6.2 of my PhD thesis, which is adapted from [2012.14799](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14799):

* [01](01_Fits.ipynb): Best fit points for each Scenario for Table 6.2
* [02](02_LikelihoodPlots.ipynb): Plots for Scenarios IV, V, VI and XI for Figure 6.1
* [03](03_RKRD.ipynb): Calculation of the central values and uncertainties for the RK(\*) and RD(\*) ratios for Table 6.3 and Figure 6.2.
* [04](04_ScenarioVII.ipynb): Hessian matrix and ellipse points for Scenario VII. Eqs (6.18) and (6.22), and Table 6.4. Pulls from all observables for Figure 6.3 and Appendix C.1. Largest pull differences for Table 6.5. Figure 6.4.
