# Fits to SMEFT coefficients II and Machine Learning

This series of notebooks contain all the code to reproduce the data in Chapter 7 of my PhD thesis, which is adapted from [2109.07405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07405)

* [01](01_fits.ipynb): Fits to Scenarios I and II and their errors. Pulls in Scenario II.
* [02](02_plotfits.ipynb): Plots for $\alpha^l$ vs $\beta^\ell$ and $\alpha^q$ vs $\beta^q$ in Scenario II.
* [03](03_RKRD.ipynb): Plots for RK and RD observables in Scenario I and II.
* [04](04_TrainingDatasets.ipynb): Preparation of the datasets to train the Machine Learning algorithm.
* [05](05_Training.ipynb): Training of the ML algorithm. Regression, histogram and SHAP values.
* [06](06_correlations.ipynb): Correlation matrices for Wilson Coefficients and for observables in the dataset generated by the ML algorithm.
